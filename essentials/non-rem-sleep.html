Each of these stages is discussed in more detail below.</p><p>NREM sleep can be identified and quantified by brain wave patterns alone, as they are clearly different from those of both wakefulness and REM sleep with the exception of a little bit of ambiguity that sometimes occurs at sleep onset. Brain wave patterns are also what distinguish the four stages of NREM from each other.
</p><h2 class="serif_text">Stage 1</h2><p>Stage 1 sleep is a transition period from wakefulness to the other 3 stages of non-REM sleep. It is of short duration, usually lasting only from 1 to 7 minutes. Stage 1 sleep is characterized by low voltage, mixed frequency EEG, as well as some slow, rolling eye movements and some relatively higher EMG activity.
</p><h2 class="serif_text">Stage 2</h2><p>Stage 2 makes up the bulk of an average person's sleep each night, around 40 to 45 percent. A sleep researcher can easily recognize stage 2 sleep because of the presence of sleep spindles and K-complexes in the EEG waves. A sleep spindle is a rapid wax and wane of the EEG waves in a 1 to 2 second interval, while a K-complex is a large wax and wane of the wave that somewhat resembles a mountain.
</p><h2 class="serif_text">Stage 3</h2><p>Stage 3 and stage 4 are similar and both fall into the category of slow wave sleep. They are so named because of the high amplitude waves in the EEG. In order to qualify as stage 3 sleep, these slow waves must be present in no more than 50 percent of the epoch. The waves are also referred to as delta waves.
</p><h2 class="serif_text">Stage 4</h2><p>Stage 4 is the other slow wave sleep period. In order to qualify as stage 4 sleep the high amplitude delta waves must be present in more than 50 percent of the epoch.

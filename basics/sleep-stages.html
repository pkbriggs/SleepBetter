The latter type of sleep has four different stages:
</p><h2 class="serif_text">Stage 1</h2><p>This sleep occurs in the first moments after you have laid your head down on your pillow and closed your eyes. The eyes move slowly and muscle movement ceases. In this stage, the sleeper can be easily awakened by noise or other disturbances as she drifts in and out of sleep.
</p><h2 class="serif_text">Stage 2</h2><p>In this stage of sleep, the person is actually asleep and the sleeper is not aware of her surroundings. Body temperature drops, breathing and heart rate are regular, and eye movements decrease significantly or are non-existent. Brain waves slow down, though there may be bursts of activity.
</p><h2 class="serif_text">Stage 3</h2><p>This is deep sleep, characterized by even slower brain waves and less sporadic bursts of brain wave activity. Breathing slows and muscles relax. Sleepers are hard to awaken during this stage. Children sometimes wet the bed during this stage of sleep.
</p><h2 class="serif_text">Stage 4</h2><p>This is the deepest sleep and is characterized by very slow brain waves and no sporadic bursts of brain wave activity. As with Stage 3 sleep, sleepers are hard to wake up.
</p><h2 class="serif_text">Stage 5</h2><p>Stage 5, as known as REM sleep, is the sleep during which we dream. It is characterized by rapid eye movements even though the eyes are closed. Breathing is rapid, irregular, and shallow. The heart rate and blood pressure increase. Arms and leg muscles experience a type of paralysis that keeps people from acting out their dreams.
